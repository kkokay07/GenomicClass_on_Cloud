# 🧬 GWAS for Beginners: Where SNPs Meet Statistics! 
>[Guidance for complete implementation on your data is available here](https://github.com/kkokay07/pq-genetics/tree/main/GWAS)
## Welcome to the DNA Detective Academy! 🔍

Ever wondered why some people love coriander leaves while others think it tastes like soap? Or why your friend can drink coffee at midnight and still sleep like a baby but you are not? Well, get ready to dive into the fascinating world of Genome-Wide Association Studies (GWAS), where we hunt for genetic variants that make us uniquely human!

### What's This All About?

This interactive Google Colab notebook is your ticket to becoming a genomics detective. No fancy supercomputers needed - just your curiosity and an internet connection! 

#### 🎯 What You'll Learn:
- How to wrangle genomic data
- Turn millions of SNPs into meaningful insights
- Create those fancy Manhattan plots
- Understand p-values without having an existential crisis
- Spot the difference between true associations and statistical noise

### Prerequisites:
- Basic Python knowledge (if you can print "Hello World!", you're halfway there!)
- A Google account (you have one, right?)
- A passion for understanding why humans are wonderfully weird
- Coffee (optional!)

### 🚀 Getting Started:

1. Click the "Open in Colab" button above (it's like a teleporter to your genomics journey)
2. Make a copy of the notebook (File -> Save a copy in Drive)
3. Follow along with our step-by-step guide
4. Congratulations! You're now doing science! 🎉

### 📚 What's Inside:

This tutorial walks you through:
- Data preprocessing (aka making your data less messy)
- Quality control (because garbage in = garbage out)
- Association testing (the moment of truth!)
- Visualization (making pretty plots that actually mean something)

### ⚠️ Common Pitfalls:

- Don't panic if you see millions of p-values
- Remember: correlation doesn't imply causation (we'll say this about 100 times)
