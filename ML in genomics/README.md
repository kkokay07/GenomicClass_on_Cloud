# 🧬 Machine Learning in Cancer Genomics

A repository demonstrating various machine learning models for cancer classification using genomic data.

## Overview 🎯
This repository contains implementations of different machine learning algorithms applied to cancer genomics data. Each model is structured to demonstrate its unique approach to classification tasks.

## Repository Structure 📁
- Example data: common_cancers.csv containing both genetic data and phenotype information
- `xgboost/` (coming soon)
- `logistic_regression/` - Logistic regression with mathematical approach
- `decision_trees/` - Decision tree classifier implementation
- `random_forest/` - Random forest model with genomic markers
- `ann/` (coming soon)
- Others (on demand)

## Why ML in Cancer Genomics? 🔬
Machine learning helps unlock patterns in complex genomic data, enabling:
- Faster and more accurate cancer classification
- Identification of important genetic markers
- Better understanding of gene interactions

## Getting Started 🚀
1. Click on .ipynb notebook
2. Click "open in colab"
   
## Note ⭐
Each notebook in different folders contains detailed implementation with:
- Data preprocessing steps
- Model training
- Evaluation metrics
- Feature importance analysis
