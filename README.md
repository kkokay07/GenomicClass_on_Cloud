# 🧬 Genomic Class on Cloud: Where DNA Meets the Cloud! 

A collection of ready-to-run Google Colab notebooks for genomic analysis and machine learning in bioinformatics.

## What's Inside? 📚
Currently featuring:
- 🔍 VCF Calling Notebooks - Because finding variants shouldn't be variant!
- 🧮 GWAS Analysis - Genome-wide association studies made friendly
- 🤖 ML Cancer Classification - Teaching machines to be genome detectives
- 🎯 Feature Extraction - Finding needles in the genomic haystack

## Why Colab? ☁️
- **Free GPU/TPU** - Because your laptop deserves a break
- **Zero Setup** - No more "works on my machine" syndrome
- **Share & Collaborate** - Like Google Docs, but for bioinformatics
- **Pre-installed Libraries** - Save time for actual analysis
- **Persistent Storage** - Google Drive integration
- **Interactive Learning** - Code, visualize, learn, repeat!

## How to Use 🚀
1. Click on notebook links
2. Open in Google Colab
3. Run cells and learn!
4. Save your own copy to experiment

## Coming Soon... 🌟
More notebooks on:
- Population genetics
- RNA-seq analysis
- Deep learning in genomics
- And whatever cool genomic stuff we think of next!

## Purpose 🎯
Making genomics and bioinformatics:
- Accessible (no setup headaches)
- Understandable (detailed explanations)
- Practical (real-world applications)
- Fun (yes, bioinformatics can be fun!)

## For Whom? 👥
- Students learning bioinformatics
- Researchers wanting quick starts
